# first-portfolio-homework

This project is my first homework challenge that I had to build from scratch. It was certainly a challenge, but overall I am proud of how it turned out. I have been going through a bit of a rough patch personally so it feels good to be productive and get something done. My goal with this progress was to make a portfolio with a good foundation that not only meets the requirments of my asignment, but can be used as a tool moving forward. I was especially happy ith how my social media buttons turned out. The biggest challenge was easily the media screens. It was something new for me, and something I am looking forward to improving apon in the future. Overall, this prject was a ton of fun and I feel like I am a better developer then I was beforehand.
